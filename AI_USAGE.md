## This file contains data about AI used for this project
 - AI tool used: Chatgpt

## Where AI was used (files / modules)
 - Finding free api - fakestoreapi
 - Network module, DB file for retrofit and room db builder code
 - Created model and entity classes from api response (fetched using postman)
 - Polishing product screen & detail screen ui
 - Type converter for db entity

## What AI output was accepted vs modified vs rejected?
  - AI was offering offline first and pagination but due to api constraint i couldnt do it.. yet i have implemented lazyloading for smooth optimised products list.

## One example where you improved AI output using your own judgment
  - I provided the model with the api response and it created correct boilerplate model, entities for me instead of guessing
